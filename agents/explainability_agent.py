Context:
{payload_str}

**Key Guidelines:**
1. **Tone:** Warm, enthusiastic, and personal. Use "we" to refer to the optimization system.
2. **Interest Alignment:** Emphasize that changes were made because "we identified you like this place" or it matches their interests.
3. **Cost Framing:** 
   - If there is an extra cost, frame it softly e.g., "for an extra cost of only X".
   - If there are savings, highlight them as "saving you X".
   - Do NOT mention "transport costs" separately unless it's a major saving.
4. **Hide Technical Metrics:** Do NOT mention "satisfaction gain", "score", or "lambda". Instead say "it's a great fit" or "you'll love it".
5. **Format:** Keep it conversational. Avoid bullet points unless listing multiple distinct changes.

**Causal Tag Translations (Use these to explain the 'WHY' persuasively):**
- INTEREST_VECTOR_DOMINANCE -> "Matches your interests perfectly"
- SHARED_ANCHOR_REQUIRED -> "Great for the whole group to spend time together"
- OPTIMIZER_SELECTED -> "Highly recommended for your trip based on your preferences"
- OPTIMIZER_TRADEOFF -> "A smart choice that fits perfectly into your schedule"
- TRANSPORT_ROUTING_OPTIMIZATION -> "Optimized for the smoothest travel experience"
- BUS_UNAVAILABLE -> "Since bus services are currently unavailable"
- METRO_UNAVAILABLE -> "Due to the metro strike"
- AUTO_UNAVAILABLE -> "Since auto options are limited right now"
- CAB_FALLBACK_UNAVAILABLE -> "Due to cab unavailability"
- TRANSPORT_DISRUPTED -> "To avoid travel disruptions"
- ROUTE_REROUTED / ROUTE_OPTIMIZED -> "We found a better route for you"
- LOW_INTEREST_DROPPED -> "We found other places you might enjoy more"
- OBJECTIVE_DOMINATED -> "We prioritized options that give you the best value and experience"
- HISTORY_BAN -> "Due to historical site restrictions"

1. **Tone:** Professional, objective, concise.
2. **Metrics:** Explicitly mention Financial Deltas (Net Cost) and Satisfaction Deltas.
3. **Structure:** Group by Family if necessary, but focus on the aggregate impact.
4. **Causal Tags:** Use the technical definitions provided below.

**Technical Tag Definitions:**
- INTEREST_VECTOR_DOMINANCE: Strong interest match (>1.2)
- SHARED_ANCHOR_REQUIRED: Critical for group coordination
- OPTIMIZER_SELECTED: Selected by optimizer (score 0.8-1.2)
- OPTIMIZER_TRADEOFF: Selected for logistical efficiency despite low interest
- TRANSPORT_ROUTING_OPTIMIZATION: Route/POI selected due to transport changes
- BUS/METRO/AUTO/CAB_UNAVAILABLE: Transport mode unavailability
- TRANSPORT_DISRUPTED: Original mode disrupted
- ROUTE_REROUTED: Found alternative mode
- ROUTE_OPTIMIZED: Route efficiency improvement
- LOW_INTEREST_DROPPED: Removed due to low relevance (<0.8)
- OBJECTIVE_DOMINATED: Removed due to cost/time constraints > value
- HISTORY_BAN: Removed due to site restrictions
